# boardgamegeeks
This is a boardgame inventory API

## NOTES
George's current package list gets angry with itself; it's our choice whether we want to experiment with ripping things out, but "npm i --force" tends to do the trick"

The overall skeleton is mostly happy and ready to accept the controllers and later the swagger

OAuth is currently on so we may choose to comment out the relevant sections for easy .rest usage (specifically in the routes files)


## TO DO
Add whatever we think as necessary
Remove as things get done
Add notes for things in progress but incomplete during pushes (I guess?)
